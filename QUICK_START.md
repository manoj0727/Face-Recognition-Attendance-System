• 0.7 = Balanced (recommended)
• 0.5 = Lenient (use if false negatives)

Quality Threshold (0.3-0.8):

## 🎓 Understanding the Display

### During Registration:
- **Green box** = Good quality (>0.6) - Press SPACE
- **Orange box** = Low quality - Improve lighting
- **No box** = No face detected - Move closer

### During Attendance:
- **Green box + Name** = Recognized ✅
- **Red box "Unknown"** = Not recognized ❌
- **Orange box "Low Quality"** = Need better lighting ⚠️
- **Confidence score** = How sure the system is (0.0-1.0)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No face detected" during registration?
✅ Improve lighting
✅ Move closer to camera (but not too close)
✅ Face camera directly

### Unknown person during attendance?
✅ Re-register with better lighting
✅ Capture 5-7 images (not just 3)
✅ Ensure quality > 0.6 during registration
✅ Check Settings → Reduce recognition threshold

### Slow performance?
✅ Settings → Increase frame skip to 3-4
✅ Close other applications
✅ Reduce camera resolution

### Wrong person recognized?
✅ Settings → Increase recognition threshold to 0.75-0.8
✅ Re-register with more images (7)
✅ Ensure good lighting during both registration & attendance
